I’ve been in Melbourne for about 3 years now, and have found this place to be completely diverse from the place where I come from as in India, I used to lead a life with an unique culture that is followed which is very traditional where people follow different religions, speak different languages and so on. At first, when I came here, It was kind of frustrating as I found myself lagging behind in so many things especially having trouble with understanding the fast accent of English speakers. But now, as days passed, I feel like I speak good English than some of them originated here. Australia has taught me so much in-terms of being Independent, fearless, a fun-filled person, and dedicated in whatever I do.</p>

				<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
			</header>			  
			<p>My long term goal is to become an Entrepreneur by starting my own business line. At first I thought I’ll do some business only related course and it just struck me back then how I always wanted to know how all these application in any mobile device work or how exactly a computer operates and I thought to myself if I’m going to become an Entrepreneur, I should not only train myself to be good in the business side but also the technology point of view, and other major things that gave me an idea of opting for a business course combined with IT touch in it. </p>
			<p>I chose RMIT to pursue my studies as I came to know that it was one of the tier 1 University and specialises in business and IT. Also, RMIT offered my course at low price when compared to Monash and Melbourne University which is other top Universities.</p>
			<p>During my studies, I expect to be trained completely for the workplace and of course a good communication skills, a good team player, and looking forward to improve my leadership qualities.</p>

				<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
				<p>My current goal is to become a Business Analyst in-order to gain a lot of experience to carry out my long-term goal which is to become an Entrepreneur.<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/business-analyst-jobs">Business-Analyst</a></p>
				
				<img src="BA.jpg">
				
				<p>I believe Business Analysts are responsible to analyse the problems of the firm and find solutions that are relevant by engaging with both programming side and business side of an organisation which is more like a middle-men. This position is appealing to me considering the fact that it requires me to possess a problem-solving mindset, and that others in the organisation will rely on our decision to make any changes in an organisation with regard to profit making and flourishing.</p>
			        
				<p>Major skills that are considered important to become a Business Analyst is to have a Competent Verbal Communication, Time-management skills, Excellent Listening skills, Documenting and writing reports etc for which I feel like I already possess such skills and qualities. The ability to solve a problem and critical thinking are some of the major qualities that are expected from a good analyst.  A minimum of 5 years of experience in business analysis field will be essential to become a senior Business Analyst and also the ability to influence stakeholders and work closely with them to determine acceptable solutions are expected for which I’m planning to go internships in-order to gain experience.</p>
			        
				<p>My plan to gain the experience and qualifications in-order to become a Business Analyst is that - To gain work experience by doing internships and projects that are concerned with gaining the skills first. Secondly, Apply for a junior Analyst position or as an Assistant part time or full time. But before all this to undertake I’ll make sure I get the relevant knowledge by undertaking some appropriate course that would get me a valid certificate.</p>

				<h3>Personal profile</h3>
				
				<h4><u> Myers-Briggs Test </u></h4>
				
				<p>Click this<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality">Myers-Briggs</a>to view my result.</p>
				
				<h4><u> Learning Style Test </u></h4>

				<h4><u> Creativity Test </u></h4>
				
			        <img src="creativitytest.jpg">
				
				<p>The Myers-Briggs test results helped me realise which personality I possess and what type of a person I really am and also my strengths and weaknesses. The learning style test which I took shows that I’m a Visual learner and it is so true that I always visualise any subject or a learning material in-order to remember them. It also have suggested on what to do to learn better such as drawing pictures to help explain new concepts and then understand the pictures, colour coding things, using flashcards to learn new words, writing down key-words which will help me to be a better student. The creativity test shows that I’m a very creative person which motivates me to do things more creatively and in my way.</p>
				
				<p>As Myers-Briggs said that I love to help people which I think what I will do while working with a Team and help my teammates with what knowledge I have and make sure we achieve success together. I will strive to be more creative and suggests new ideas and try to advocate people by understanding what their mind-set is.</p>
				
				<p>I think I will be looking for teammates who has got other qualities than what I’ve got so that I personally will have an opportunity to know more about other qualities and that might as well help the team to progress.</p>

				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>The Application will be downloaded from the website or Appstore and will have several online stores connected or collaborated with the Application. The features and the procedures of the Application are explained below:</p>
				<li>Firstly, the Application should be downloaded by the collaborated manufacturers and will have to enter every product available that is capable to fit in a human body which will later be used for trial by users in a database that comes within the app as a built-in function and the manufacturers will just have to sign-up in the App to enable display of their products.</li>
				<li>In-order for users to trial a product, They will have to go through the products available in the feed or search for a particular store and surf through the products.</li>
				<li>The next step is to add the products they wish to try on to the favourites section available, using the favourite button displayed on the product which brings the user to the next step where they'll have to use their device's camera by enabling their camera to connect with the App to scan their body or the respective parts for the programmed machine to generate a 3D model of their figure and calculate a defined measurements of the figure or the users could simply enter their measurements manually through the App.</li>
				<li>There will be a user guide to help the users connect with the idea.</li>
				<li>Then, the image will automatically be linked to the products in the favourite section of the App.</li>
				<li>The user will have to choose which product they want the 3D model of their figure to try on which can be displayed within the app or in real-time by just turning the AR Toggle button in their phone. By doing this, the users can see how the product will look on them easily and will come to a happy conclusion.</li>
				<li>After the whole selection process, the user can add the product to the cart and the cart will redirect them to the respective website to carry out the final process of buying, As this application is only for the purpose of enhancing online purchasing experience of users by providing a real-time shopping experience and not for selling purpose though it helps in increasing online sales.</li>
